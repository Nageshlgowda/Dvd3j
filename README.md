The "Airbnb Cleaned Europe Dataset" from Kaggle is the dataset We are  utilizing. This dataset, which includes details on Airbnb listings in several European cities, was gathered by an unidentified person. The dataset, which has 358,800 rows and 16 columns, was most recently updated in 2021. 

We utilized D3 JavaScript for the analysis of Airbnb data, employing it to generate two distinct visualizations: a bar graph and a dot plot.
